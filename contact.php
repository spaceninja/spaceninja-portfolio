<h3>How can I get in contact with you?</h3>

<p class="leadtxt">I'm sorry to say, but due to abuse by recruiters, I've had to remove all my contact information from this site. That said, I'm not looking for work right now anyway, so there's not really any reason to get ahold of me. Despite this, if you feel you absolutely must get ahold of me, you can try to guess my email address (it's not tricky), or use the contact form on <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/scottvandehey">LinkedIn</a>. Any contact regarding job opportunities will be deleted and filed as spam.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to be such a pain to get ahold of. For years, I had my phone number and email posted here, and it wasn't a problem. However, for the last year or so, it's resulted in a never-ending stream of harassing phone calls from recruiters.</p>

<p>At first, I tried just leaving a message asking recruiters not to call with job opportunities. It didn't work. It did give me the opportunity when they called to ask "how did you find my number." When they said they found it on my site, I asked if they saw the note asking them not to call. In <em>every case</em>, they said they had seen the note, but ignored it so they could share this exciting opportunity with me.</p>

<p>The audacity of that statement kills me. As politely as I can, I point out to them that I didn't appreciate them ignoring that note, and asked them to remove me from their lists. Most of them would pleasantly agree, but a few would actually argue with me.</p>

<p>I know a few people who have worked as recruiters before, and I understand it's a hard job. You've got a quota to fill, and no one wants to talk to you. It sucks, I get it. BUT. My sympathy ends the <em>minute</em> you choose to harass me despite being asked not to.</p>
