<p>&ldquo;I worked with Scott at Pop Art from 2006-2009, and my standards for web site development are now considerably higher than they were before I began working with him. With his design background, he has an eye for producing great looking, standards-compliant web sites that are as easy to update as they are to look at... I would highly recommend Scott for any web work, and look forward to working with him again.&rdquo;
